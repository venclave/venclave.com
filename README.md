This is the repository that builds the static website for [venclave.com](https://venclave.com/) using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deploys to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

## Slides

If you are looking for the presentation slides I gave somewhere, look in the [static/slides/](static/slides/) directory.

## Building

With `hugo` installed, you can use `make build` for production builds and `make dev` for local development.
